    "content": "# React.js Best Practices\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive React.js best practices, patterns, and recommendations to help you build high-quality, maintainable React applications.\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse this skill when you need guidance on:\n\n- React hooks patterns and best practices\n- Performance optimization techniques\n- State management strategies\n- Component design principles\n- Testing approaches\n- Code organization and architecture\n\n## Topics Covered\n\n### 1. React Hooks Best Practices\n\n#### Rules of Hooks\n\n1. **Only call hooks at the top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions\n2. **Only call hooks from React functions** - Call hooks from React function components or custom hooks\n3. **Use exhaustive-deps rule** - Always include all dependencies in useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback\n\n#### Common Hooks Patterns\n\n**useState**\n\n- Use functional updates when the new state depends on the previous state\n- Initialize state with a function if the initial value is expensive to compute\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Functional update\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\nsetCount((prev) => prev + 1);\n\n// ✅ Good: Expensive initial state\nconst [data, setData] = useState(() => expensiveComputation());\n```\n\n**useEffect**\n\n- Always specify dependencies\n- Clean up side effects (subscriptions, timers) in the return function\n- Use separate effects for unrelated concerns\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: useEffect with cleanup\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = subscribe();\n  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, [deps]);\n\n// ❌ Bad: Missing dependencies\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchData(userId);\n}, []); // Missing userId dependency\n\n// ✅ Good: Include all dependencies\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchData(userId);\n}, [userId]);\n```\n\n**useMemo & useCallback**\n\n- Only use when you have a performance problem\n- Don't memoize everything - it has its own cost\n- useMemo for expensive calculations\n- useCallback for functions passed to memoized children\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Memoize expensive calculation\nconst expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {\n  return computeExpensiveValue(a, b);\n}, [a, b]);\n\n// ✅ Good: Memoize callback for memoized child\nconst handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n  doSomething(id);\n}, [id]);\n```\n\n### 2. Performance Optimization\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n1. **Use React.memo wisely** - Memoize components that render frequently with the same props\n2. **Code splitting** - Use React.lazy() and Suspense for route-based code splitting\n3. **Virtualize long lists** - Use libraries like react-window for long lists\n4. **Avoid inline object/function creation** - Creates new references on every render\n5. **Use production builds** - Always use production builds for deployment\n\n#### Optimization Techniques\n\n**Memoization**\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Memoized component\nconst ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {\n  return <div>{/* render */}</div>;\n});\n\n// ❌ Bad: Inline object creation\n<Component style={{ color: \"red\" }} />;\n\n// ✅ Good: Extract to constant\nconst styles = { color: \"red\" };\n<Component style={styles} />;\n```\n\n**Code Splitting**\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Code splitting\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import(\"./LazyComponent\"));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. State Management\n\n#### Guidelines\n\n1. **Lift state up** - Share state between components by lifting it to their common ancestor\n2. **Keep state local** - Don't make state global unless necessary\n3. **Use appropriate state management** - useState for local, Context for shared, Redux for complex\n4. **Normalize state shape** - Keep state normalized and flat when possible\n5. **Avoid prop drilling** - Use Context API or state management library for deep prop passing\n\n#### Patterns\n\n**Local State (useState)**\n\n- Use for component-specific state\n- Keep it simple and local\n\n**Context API**\n\n- Use for theme, auth, user preferences\n- Split contexts by concern\n- Avoid overusing Context\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Lifted state\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Child1 count={count} />\n      <Child2 setCount={setCount} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Context for shared state\nconst ThemeContext = createContext();\nfunction ThemeProvider({ children }) {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(\"light\");\n  return (\n    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>\n      {children}\n    </ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Component Design\n\n#### Principles\n\n1. **Single Responsibility** - Each component should do one thing well\n2. **Composition over Inheritance** - Use composition to build complex UIs\n3. **Keep components small** - Aim for components under 200 lines\n4. **Use TypeScript** - Type your props and state\n5. **Extract reusable logic** - Create custom hooks for shared logic\n\n#### Patterns\n\n**Container/Presentational Pattern**\n\n- Container: Handles data fetching and state\n- Presentational: Handles UI rendering\n\n**Custom Hooks**\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Custom hook for reusable logic\nfunction useCounter(initialValue = 0) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);\n  const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1);\n  return { count, increment };\n}\n```\n\n**TypeScript Props**\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: TypeScript props\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: string;\n  onClick: () => void;\n  variant?: \"primary\" | \"secondary\";\n}\n\nfunction Button({ label, onClick, variant = \"primary\" }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick} className={variant}>\n      {label}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Testing\n\n#### Guidelines\n\n1. **Test user behavior, not implementation** - Test what users see and do\n2. **Use React Testing Library** - Prefer over Enzyme\n3. **Test accessibility** - Ensure components are accessible\n4. **Mock external dependencies** - Mock API calls, timers, etc.\n5. **Keep tests simple** - One assertion per test when possible\n\n#### Examples\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Test user behavior\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { Button } from \"./Button\";\n\ntest(\"increments counter when clicked\", () => {\n  render(<Button onClick={increment} />);\n  const button = screen.getByRole(\"button\");\n  fireEvent.click(button);\n  expect(screen.getByText(\"Count: 1\")).toBeInTheDocument();\n});\n\n// ✅ Good: Test accessibility\ntest(\"button is accessible\", () => {\n  render(<Button aria-label=\"Submit\" />);\n  expect(screen.getByRole(\"button\", { name: /submit/i })).toBeInTheDocument();\n});\n```\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [React Documentation](https://react.dev)\n- [React Patterns](https://reactpatterns.com)\n- [React TypeScript Cheatsheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app)\n- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Proper Hook Usage\n\n```tsx\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let cancelled = false;\n\n    async function fetchUser() {\n      setLoading(true);\n      const data = await getUser(userId);\n      if (!cancelled) {\n        setUser(data);\n        setLoading(false);\n      }\n    }\n\n    fetchUser();\n    return () => {\n      cancelled = true;\n    };\n  }, [userId]);\n\n  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Performance Optimization\n\n```tsx\nconst ExpensiveList = React.memo(({ items }: { items: Item[] }) => {\n  const sortedItems = useMemo(() => {\n    return items.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);\n  }, [items]);\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {sortedItems.map((item) => (\n        <ListItem key={item.id} item={item} />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n});\n```\n",

    "content": "# React Component Generator\n\nThis skill generates React component code in markdown format with TypeScript types, including props definitions, optional styling examples, and test examples.\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse this skill when you need to:\n- Generate React component boilerplate code\n- Create TypeScript-typed React components\n- Generate functional or class components\n- Include prop type definitions\n- Add styling and test examples\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Component Generation\n\nGenerate a simple functional component:\n\n**Input:**\n- Component name: `Button`\n- Component type: `functional`\n- Props: `[{ name: \"label\", type: \"string\", required: true }, { name: \"onClick\", type: \"() => void\", required: false }]`\n\n**Output:** Complete React component code in markdown format with TypeScript types.\n\n### Advanced Component Generation\n\nGenerate a component with styling and tests:\n\n**Input:**\n- Component name: `Card`\n- Component type: `functional`\n- Props: `[{ name: \"title\", type: \"string\", required: true }, { name: \"children\", type: \"ReactNode\", required: false }]`\n- Include styles: `true`\n- Include tests: `true`\n\n**Output:** Complete component with TypeScript types, CSS styling example, and test examples.\n\n## Component Types\n\n### Functional Components\n\nFunctional components are the recommended approach in modern React. They use hooks for state and lifecycle management.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { FC } from \"react\";\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: string;\n  onClick?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick }) => {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n      {label}\n    </button>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Class Components\n\nClass components use the traditional React component class syntax. Use when you need specific class component features.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```tsx\nimport { Component } from \"react\";\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: string;\n  onClick?: () => void;\n}\n\ninterface ButtonState {}\n\nexport class Button extends Component<ButtonProps, ButtonState> {\n  render() {\n    const { label, onClick } = this.props;\n    return (\n      <button onClick={onClick}>\n        {label}\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Props Definition\n\nProps are defined using TypeScript interfaces with the following structure:\n\n- **name**: Prop name (camelCase)\n- **type**: TypeScript type (e.g., `string`, `number`, `ReactNode`, `() => void`)\n- **required**: Boolean indicating if the prop is required\n\n**Example:**\n\n```tsx\ninterface CardProps {\n  title: string;           // Required prop\n  description?: string;    // Optional prop\n  onClick: () => void;     // Required function prop\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';  // Optional enum prop\n}\n```\n\n## Styling Options\n\nWhen `includeStyles` is enabled, the generator includes CSS styling examples:\n\n```css\n.button {\n  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;\n  border: none;\n  border-radius: 0.25rem;\n  background-color: #007bff;\n  color: white;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n.button:hover {\n  background-color: #0056b3;\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Examples\n\nWhen `includeTests` is enabled, the generator includes test examples using React Testing Library:\n\n```tsx\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from \"@testing-library/react\";\nimport { Button } from \"./Button\";\n\ndescribe(\"Button\", () => {\n  it(\"renders correctly\", () => {\n    render(<Button label=\"Click me\" />);\n    expect(screen.getByRole(\"button\")).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it(\"calls onClick when clicked\", () => {\n    const handleClick = jest.fn();\n    render(<Button label=\"Click me\" onClick={handleClick} />);\n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole(\"button\"));\n    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Complete Example\n\n### Input Parameters\n\n```json\n{\n  \"componentName\": \"UserCard\",\n  \"componentType\": \"functional\",\n  \"props\": [\n    { \"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\", \"required\": true },\n    { \"name\": \"email\", \"type\": \"string\", \"required\": true },\n    { \"name\": \"avatar\", \"type\": \"string\", \"required\": false },\n    { \"name\": \"onClick\", \"type\": \"() => void\", \"required\": false }\n  ],\n  \"includeStyles\": true,\n  \"includeTests\": true,\n  \"description\": \"A card component displaying user information\"\n}\n```\n\n### Generated Output\n\nThe generator will produce a complete markdown document containing:\n\n1. **Component Code** - Full TypeScript React component\n2. **Styling** - CSS example (if requested)\n3. **Tests** - Test examples (if requested)\n4. **Usage** - Example usage code\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen generating components:\n\n1. **Use TypeScript** - Always define prop types\n2. **Keep components focused** - Single responsibility principle\n3. **Use descriptive prop names** - Clear, self-documenting code\n4. **Include default values** - For optional props when appropriate\n5. **Consider accessibility** - Add ARIA attributes when needed\n\n## Common Prop Types\n\n- `string` - Text values\n- `number` - Numeric values\n- `boolean` - True/false values\n- `ReactNode` - Any renderable React content\n- `() => void` - Event handlers\n- `'option1' | 'option2'` - Union types for enums\n- `Array<T>` - Arrays of specific types\n- `Record<string, unknown>` - Object types\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Simple Button Component\n\n```tsx\nimport { FC } from \"react\";\n\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  label: string;\n  onClick?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick }) => {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n      {label}\n    </button>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Example 2: Complex Card Component\n\n```tsx\nimport { FC, ReactNode } from \"react\";\n\ninterface CardProps {\n  title: string;\n  description?: string;\n  children?: ReactNode;\n  variant?: 'default' | 'outlined' | 'elevated';\n  onAction?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport const Card: FC<CardProps> = ({\n  title,\n  description,\n  children,\n  variant = 'default',\n  onAction,\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <div className={`card card-${variant}`}>\n      <h3>{title}</h3>\n      {description && <p>{description}</p>}\n      {children}\n      {onAction && <button onClick={onAction}>Action</button>}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n",

    "content": "# Vercel Deploy\n\nThis skill enables deploying web applications to Vercel directly from conversations or automated workflows. It provides automatic framework detection, preview deployments, and claimable URLs for transferring ownership.\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse this skill when you need to:\n\n- Deploy a web application to Vercel\n- Create a preview deployment for testing\n- Share a live preview with stakeholders\n- Transfer deployment ownership to another user\n- Deploy static HTML projects\n- Quickly prototype and share ideas\n\n## Features\n\n### Automatic Framework Detection\n\nThe skill automatically detects the framework from your `package.json` and configures the deployment accordingly.\n\n**Supported Frameworks (40+):**\n\n| Framework | Detection Method |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| Next.js | `next` in dependencies |\n| React | `react-scripts` or `create-react-app` |\n| Vue.js | `@vue/cli-service` or `vite` with Vue |\n| Nuxt | `nuxt` in dependencies |\n| Svelte/SvelteKit | `@sveltejs/kit` or `svelte` |\n| Angular | `@angular/core` |\n| Remix | `@remix-run/react` |\n| Astro | `astro` in dependencies |\n| Gatsby | `gatsby` in dependencies |\n| Vite | `vite` in dependencies |\n| Express | `express` in dependencies |\n| Fastify | `fastify` in dependencies |\n| Nest.js | `@nestjs/core` |\n| Static HTML | No package.json detected |\n\n### Preview Deployments\n\nEvery deployment generates:\n\n1. **Preview URL** - A unique URL for the deployment (e.g., `https://project-abc123.vercel.app`)\n2. **Claim URL** - A URL to transfer ownership of the deployment\n\n### Project Packaging\n\nThe skill packages your project for deployment with the following behavior:\n\n- **Excludes** `node_modules/` (dependencies are installed on Vercel)\n- **Excludes** `.git/` directory\n- **Excludes** files matching `.vercelignore` patterns\n- **Includes** all other source files and configurations\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basic Deployment\n\nDeploy a project with default settings:\n\n**Input:**\n```json\n{\n  \"projectPath\": \"./my-app\"\n}\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```markdown\n# Deployment Successful\n\n**Preview URL:** https://my-app-abc123.vercel.app\n**Claim URL:** https://vercel.com/claim/abc123def456\n\nYour deployment is live! Share the preview URL with stakeholders.\nTo claim ownership, visit the claim URL while signed into Vercel.\n```\n\n### Deployment with Options\n\nDeploy with custom configuration:\n\n**Input:**\n```json\n{\n  \"projectPath\": \"./my-app\",\n  \"name\": \"my-awesome-project\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"API_URL\": \"https://api.example.com\",\n    \"NODE_ENV\": \"production\"\n  },\n  \"buildCommand\": \"npm run build\",\n  \"outputDirectory\": \"dist\"\n}\n```\n\n### Static HTML Deployment\n\nDeploy a static HTML site (no package.json required):\n\n**Input:**\n```json\n{\n  \"projectPath\": \"./static-site\",\n  \"framework\": \"static\"\n}\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n### Required Parameters\n\n- **projectPath** (string) - Path to the project directory to deploy\n\n### Optional Parameters\n\n- **name** (string) - Custom project name for the deployment\n- **framework** (string) - Override auto-detected framework\n- **buildCommand** (string) - Custom build command\n- **outputDirectory** (string) - Custom output directory for built files\n- **env** (object) - Environment variables for the deployment\n- **regions** (string[]) - Deployment regions (default: auto)\n- **public** (boolean) - Whether the deployment should be public (default: false)\n\n## Deployment Process\n\n### Step 1: Project Analysis\n\nThe skill analyzes your project:\n\n1. Reads `package.json` to detect framework and dependencies\n2. Checks for configuration files (`next.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.)\n3. Determines optimal build settings\n\n### Step 2: Packaging\n\nThe project is packaged for upload:\n\n```\nproject/\n├── package.json      ✓ Included\n├── src/              ✓ Included\n├── public/           ✓ Included\n├── .env.local        ✓ Included (encrypted)\n├── node_modules/     ✗ Excluded\n└── .git/             ✗ Excluded\n```\n\n### Step 3: Deployment\n\nThe package is deployed to Vercel:\n\n1. Files are uploaded to Vercel's infrastructure\n2. Dependencies are installed\n3. Build command is executed\n4. Output is deployed to the edge network\n\n### Step 4: Results\n\nThe skill returns:\n\n- Preview URL for immediate access\n- Claim URL for ownership transfer\n- Build logs (if requested)\n- Deployment metadata\n\n## Framework-Specific Configuration\n\n### Next.js\n\n```json\n{\n  \"framework\": \"nextjs\",\n  \"buildCommand\": \"next build\",\n  \"outputDirectory\": \".next\"\n}\n```\n\n**Auto-detected features:**\n- API Routes\n- Image Optimization\n- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)\n- Edge Functions\n\n### Vite + React\n\n```json\n{\n  \"framework\": \"vite\",\n  \"buildCommand\": \"vite build\",\n  \"outputDirectory\": \"dist\"\n}\n```\n\n### SvelteKit\n\n```json\n{\n  \"framework\": \"sveltekit\",\n  \"buildCommand\": \"vite build\",\n  \"outputDirectory\": \".svelte-kit\"\n}\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n### Setting Environment Variables\n\nPass environment variables for the deployment:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"projectPath\": \"./my-app\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"DATABASE_URL\": \"postgres://...\",\n    \"API_KEY\": \"secret_key_here\",\n    \"NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL\": \"https://api.example.com\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Environment Variable Types\n\n| Prefix | Availability |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `NEXT_PUBLIC_` | Client + Server (Next.js) |\n| `VITE_` | Client + Server (Vite) |\n| No prefix | Server only |\n\n## Claiming Deployments\n\nAfter deployment, you receive a **Claim URL**. This allows:\n\n1. **Ownership Transfer** - Take ownership of the deployment\n2. **Custom Domain** - Add your own domain\n3. **Team Integration** - Add to your Vercel team\n4. **Analytics Access** - View deployment analytics\n\n### Claim Process\n\n1. Visit the claim URL\n2. Sign in to Vercel (or create an account)\n3. Choose to add to personal account or team\n4. Optionally connect a Git repository\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Common Errors\n\n**Build Failed**\n```\nError: Build command failed with exit code 1\nSolution: Check build logs for specific errors\n```\n\n**Missing Dependencies**\n```\nError: Cannot find module 'xyz'\nSolution: Ensure all dependencies are in package.json\n```\n\n**Output Directory Not Found**\n```\nError: Output directory 'dist' not found\nSolution: Verify outputDirectory matches your build output\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n1. **Check package.json** - Ensure all dependencies are listed\n2. **Verify build command** - Test locally first\n3. **Check environment variables** - Ensure required vars are set\n4. **Review .vercelignore** - Make sure needed files aren't ignored\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use Environment Variables for Secrets\n\nNever hardcode sensitive data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"API_KEY\": \"${process.env.API_KEY}\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Optimize for Preview\n\nFor preview deployments:\n\n- Use smaller datasets\n- Enable development features\n- Add watermarks if needed\n\n### 3. Test Locally First\n\nBefore deploying:\n\n```bash\n# Build locally\nnpm run build\n\n# Preview locally\nnpm run preview\n```\n\n### 4. Use Meaningful Names\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"feature-user-auth-v2\"\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Examples\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\n```yaml\nname: Deploy Preview\non: [pull_request]\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - name: Deploy to Vercel\n        run: npx vercel-deploy --project-path .\n```\n\n### Automated Testing\n\nDeploy, test, then report:\n\n```typescript\n// Deploy\nconst deployment = await deploy({\n  projectPath: './app',\n  name: `test-${Date.now()}`\n});\n\n// Test\nconst response = await fetch(deployment.previewUrl);\nexpect(response.status).toBe(200);\n\n// Report\nconsole.log(`Preview: ${deployment.previewUrl}`);\n```\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)\n- [Vercel CLI Reference](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)\n- [Framework Guides](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks)\n- [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Deploy Next.js App\n\n**Input:**\n```json\n{\n  \"projectPath\": \"./my-nextjs-app\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL\": \"https://api.example.com\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```markdown\n# Deployment Successful\n\n**Framework:** Next.js 14.0.0\n**Build Time:** 45s\n**Preview URL:** https://my-nextjs-app-abc123.vercel.app\n**Claim URL:** https://vercel.com/claim/xyz789\n\n## Build Summary\n- Pages: 12 static, 3 dynamic\n- API Routes: 5\n- Edge Functions: 2\n- Total Size: 2.3 MB\n```\n\n### Example 2: Deploy Static Site\n\n**Input:**\n```json\n{\n  \"projectPath\": \"./landing-page\",\n  \"framework\": \"static\"\n}\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```markdown\n# Deployment Successful\n\n**Framework:** Static HTML\n**Build Time:** 5s\n**Preview URL:** https://landing-page-def456.vercel.app\n**Claim URL:** https://vercel.com/claim/abc123\n\n## Deployment Info\n- Files: 15\n- Total Size: 450 KB\n- CDN Regions: All\n```\n",

Accessibility\n\nEnsuring your application is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.\n\n#### Semantic HTML\n\n1. **Use semantic elements** - Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` appropriately\n2. **Proper heading hierarchy** - Use `<h1>` through `<h6>` in order without skipping levels\n3. **Landmarks** - Provide ARIA landmarks for screen reader navigation\n4. **Lists** - Use `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>` for list content\n\n```html\n<!-- ✅ Good: Semantic structure -->\n<main>\n  <article>\n    <header>\n      <h1>Article Title</h1>\n    </header>\n    <section>\n      <h2>Section Heading</h2>\n      <p>Content...</p>\n    </section>\n  </article>\n</main>\n\n<!-- ❌ Bad: Div soup -->\n<div class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"article\">\n    <div class=\"header\">\n      <div class=\"title\">Article Title</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n#### Focus Management\n\n1. **Visible focus indicators** - Never remove focus outlines without providing alternatives\n2. **Focus order** - Ensure logical tab order (use `tabindex=\"0\"` or `tabindex=\"-1\"`)\n3. **Skip links** - Provide skip navigation links for keyboard users\n4. **Focus trapping** - Trap focus in modals and dialogs\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Custom focus indicator */\nbutton:focus {\n  outline: none;\n  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(66, 153, 225, 0.6);\n}\n\n/* ❌ Bad: Removing focus without replacement */\nbutton:focus {\n  outline: none;\n}\n```\n\n#### ARIA Labels\n\n1. **Label all interactive elements** - Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`\n2. **Describe state changes** - Use `aria-live` for dynamic content\n3. **Icon buttons** - Always provide accessible names for icon-only buttons\n4. **Form inputs** - Associate labels with form controls\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Accessible icon button\n<button aria-label=\"Close dialog\">\n  <CloseIcon aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n</button>\n\n// ✅ Good: Live region for updates\n<div aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\">\n  {statusMessage}\n</div>\n\n// ❌ Bad: No accessible name\n<button>\n  <CloseIcon />\n</button>\n```\n\n#### Color and Contrast\n\n1. **Minimum contrast ratio** - 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text\n2. **Don't rely on color alone** - Use icons, patterns, or text in addition to color\n3. **Test with color blindness simulators** - Ensure usability for all users\n\n### 2. Performance\n\nOptimizing UI performance for fast, responsive experiences.\n\n#### Layout Performance\n\n1. **Avoid layout thrashing** - Batch DOM reads and writes\n2. **Use `transform` and `opacity`** - For animations (GPU-accelerated)\n3. **Minimize reflows** - Avoid changing layout properties frequently\n4. **Use `content-visibility`** - For off-screen content\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: GPU-accelerated animation */\n.animate {\n  transform: translateX(100px);\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease;\n}\n\n/* ❌ Bad: Triggers reflow */\n.animate {\n  left: 100px;\n  transition: left 0.3s ease;\n}\n```\n\n#### Virtualization\n\n1. **Virtualize long lists** - Use react-window or react-virtualized\n2. **Infinite scroll** - Load content progressively\n3. **Pagination** - For very large datasets\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Virtualized list\nimport { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';\n\n<FixedSizeList\n  height={400}\n  itemCount={10000}\n  itemSize={50}\n  width=\"100%\"\n>\n  {Row}\n</FixedSizeList>\n```\n\n#### Resource Loading\n\n1. **Lazy load images** - Use `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute\n2. **Preload critical resources** - Use `<link rel=\"preload\">`\n3. **Defer non-critical scripts** - Use `defer` or `async`\n4. **Code splitting** - Load components on demand\n\n### 3. Typography\n\nCreating readable, beautiful text experiences.\n\n#### Font Loading\n\n1. **Use `font-display: swap`** - Prevent FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)\n2. **Subset fonts** - Only include needed characters\n3. **Preload critical fonts** - Use `<link rel=\"preload\">`\n4. **System font stack fallbacks** - Provide good fallbacks\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'CustomFont';\n  src: url('/fonts/custom.woff2') format('woff2');\n  font-display: swap;\n  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF; /* Latin subset */\n}\n```\n\n#### Readability\n\n1. **Line length** - 45-75 characters per line (ideal: 66)\n2. **Line height** - 1.4-1.6 for body text\n3. **Font size** - Minimum 16px for body text\n4. **Contrast** - Sufficient contrast between text and background\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Readable typography */\n.body-text {\n  font-size: 1rem; /* 16px */\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  max-width: 65ch; /* ~65 characters */\n}\n\n/* ❌ Bad: Hard to read */\n.body-text {\n  font-size: 12px;\n  line-height: 1;\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n#### Responsive Typography\n\n1. **Use relative units** - `rem`, `em`, or `clamp()`\n2. **Scale appropriately** - Adjust sizes for different viewports\n3. **Maintain hierarchy** - Keep visual hierarchy consistent\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Fluid typography */\nh1 {\n  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 3rem);\n}\n\n/* ✅ Good: Responsive base */\nhtml {\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  html {\n    font-size: 18px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Animations\n\nCreating smooth, purposeful animations.\n\n#### Motion Preferences\n\n1. **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** - Reduce or disable animations\n2. **Provide alternatives** - Use fade instead of movement when reduced\n3. **Essential vs decorative** - Only keep essential animations\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Respecting motion preferences */\n.animated-element {\n  transition: transform 0.3s ease;\n}\n\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  .animated-element {\n    transition: opacity 0.3s ease;\n    transform: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Animation Performance\n\n1. **Use `transform` and `opacity`** - GPU-accelerated properties\n2. **Use `will-change` sparingly** - Only for known upcoming animations\n3. **Keep animations short** - 200-500ms for most interactions\n4. **Use easing functions** - Natural motion with ease-in-out\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Performant animation */\n.card {\n  transition: transform 0.2s ease-out, box-shadow 0.2s ease-out;\n}\n\n.card:hover {\n  transform: translateY(-4px);\n  box-shadow: 0 12px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n}\n```\n\n#### Meaningful Motion\n\n1. **Purpose** - Every animation should have a purpose\n2. **Direction** - Motion should indicate direction or relationship\n3. **Staggering** - Stagger list animations for visual interest\n4. **Feedback** - Provide immediate feedback for interactions\n\n### 5. Forms\n\nDesigning usable, accessible forms.\n\n#### Form Structure\n\n1. **Group related fields** - Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`\n2. **Label placement** - Labels above or to the left of inputs\n3. **Required indicators** - Mark required fields clearly\n4. **Help text** - Provide context with `aria-describedby`\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Accessible form structure\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Contact Information</legend>\n  \n  <div>\n    <label htmlFor=\"email\">\n      Email <span aria-hidden=\"true\">*</span>\n    </label>\n    <input\n      id=\"email\"\n      type=\"email\"\n      required\n      aria-required=\"true\"\n      aria-describedby=\"email-help\"\n    />\n    <p id=\"email-help\">We'll never share your email.</p>\n  </div>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n#### Validation\n\n1. **Inline validation** - Validate on blur, not on every keystroke\n2. **Clear error messages** - Specific, actionable error text\n3. **Error summary** - List all errors at form top on submit\n4. **Use native validation** - HTML5 validation attributes\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Clear error handling\n<div>\n  <label htmlFor=\"password\">Password</label>\n  <input\n    id=\"password\"\n    type=\"password\"\n    aria-invalid={errors.password ? \"true\" : \"false\"}\n    aria-describedby=\"password-error\"\n  />\n  {errors.password && (\n    <p id=\"password-error\" role=\"alert\" className=\"error\">\n      Password must be at least 8 characters with one number\n    </p>\n  )}\n</div>\n```\n\n#### Input Types\n\n1. **Use correct input types** - `email`, `tel`, `url`, `number`, `date`\n2. **Autocomplete attributes** - Help browsers autofill\n3. **Input modes** - Use `inputmode` for mobile keyboards\n\n```html\n<!-- ✅ Good: Appropriate input types -->\n<input type=\"email\" autocomplete=\"email\" />\n<input type=\"tel\" autocomplete=\"tel\" inputmode=\"tel\" />\n<input type=\"number\" inputmode=\"numeric\" />\n```\n\n### 6. Images\n\nOptimizing images for performance and accessibility.\n\n#### Image Optimization\n\n1. **Modern formats** - Use WebP or AVIF with fallbacks\n2. **Responsive images** - Use `srcset` and `sizes`\n3. **Lazy loading** - Use `loading=\"lazy\"` for below-fold images\n4. **Explicit dimensions** - Set `width` and `height` to prevent CLS\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Optimized responsive image\n<picture>\n  <source\n    srcSet=\"/image.avif\"\n    type=\"image/avif\"\n  />\n  <source\n    srcSet=\"/image.webp\"\n    type=\"image/webp\"\n  />\n  <img\n    src=\"/image.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Descriptive alt text\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    width={800}\n    height={600}\n    decoding=\"async\"\n  />\n</picture>\n```\n\n#### Alt Text\n\n1. **Descriptive** - Describe the image content and purpose\n2. **Context-aware** - Consider the surrounding content\n3. **Decorative images** - Use empty `alt=\"\"` for decorative images\n4. **Complex images** - Use `aria-describedby` for detailed descriptions\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Meaningful alt text\n<img src=\"/chart.png\" alt=\"Bar chart showing 50% increase in sales from Q1 to Q4 2024\" />\n\n// ✅ Good: Decorative image\n<img src=\"/decorative-divider.svg\" alt=\"\" role=\"presentation\" />\n```\n\n### 7. Navigation\n\nCreating intuitive navigation patterns.\n\n#### Navigation Structure\n\n1. **Consistent location** - Keep navigation in predictable places\n2. **Current page indicator** - Show active state with `aria-current=\"page\"`\n3. **Breadcrumbs** - For deep hierarchies\n4. **Mobile navigation** - Accessible hamburger menus\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Accessible navigation\n<nav aria-label=\"Main navigation\">\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/\" aria-current=\"page\">Home</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/about\">About</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"/contact\">Contact</a>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</nav>\n```\n\n#### Link Best Practices\n\n1. **Descriptive link text** - Never use \"click here\" or \"read more\"\n2. **External links** - Indicate with icon and `target=\"_blank\"` with `rel=\"noopener\"`\n3. **Skip links** - Allow keyboard users to skip to main content\n4. **Focus visible** - Ensure focused links are clearly visible\n\n### 8. Dark Mode & Theming\n\nImplementing consistent theme support.\n\n#### CSS Variables\n\n1. **Use CSS custom properties** - For easy theme switching\n2. **Semantic naming** - Name by purpose, not appearance\n3. **Fallbacks** - Provide fallback values\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Semantic theme variables */\n:root {\n  --color-background: #ffffff;\n  --color-text-primary: #1a1a1a;\n  --color-text-secondary: #6b7280;\n  --color-accent: #3b82f6;\n  --color-border: #e5e7eb;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  --color-background: #0f172a;\n  --color-text-primary: #f8fafc;\n  --color-text-secondary: #94a3b8;\n  --color-accent: #60a5fa;\n  --color-border: #334155;\n}\n```\n\n#### System Preference Detection\n\n1. **Detect system preference** - Use `prefers-color-scheme`\n2. **Allow override** - Let users choose their preference\n3. **Persist choice** - Save preference to localStorage\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: System preference detection */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root:not([data-theme=\"light\"]) {\n    --color-background: #0f172a;\n    --color-text-primary: #f8fafc;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9. Touch & Interaction\n\nDesigning for touch interfaces.\n\n#### Touch Targets\n\n1. **Minimum size** - 44x44px for touch targets (WCAG 2.2)\n2. **Spacing** - Adequate spacing between targets\n3. **Visual feedback** - Immediate response to touch\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Accessible touch targets */\n.button {\n  min-width: 44px;\n  min-height: 44px;\n  padding: 12px 24px;\n}\n\n.touch-feedback {\n  transition: transform 0.1s ease;\n}\n\n.touch-feedback:active {\n  transform: scale(0.98);\n}\n```\n\n#### Gestures\n\n1. **Provide alternatives** - Don't rely solely on gestures\n2. **Discoverable** - Make gesture-based actions visible\n3. **Cancel-able** - Allow users to cancel mid-gesture\n\n### 10. Internationalization (i18n)\n\nSupporting multiple languages and locales.\n\n#### Text Direction\n\n1. **Support RTL** - Use logical properties (`margin-inline-start`)\n2. **dir attribute** - Set `dir=\"rtl\"` for RTL languages\n3. **Bidirectional text** - Handle mixed direction content\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Good: Logical properties */\n.container {\n  margin-inline-start: 1rem;\n  padding-inline-end: 1rem;\n  border-inline-start: 2px solid;\n}\n\n/* ❌ Bad: Physical properties */\n.container {\n  margin-left: 1rem;\n  padding-right: 1rem;\n  border-left: 2px solid;\n}\n```\n\n#### Number and Date Formatting\n\n1. **Use Intl API** - For locale-aware formatting\n2. **Date formats** - Respect locale date formats\n3. **Number formats** - Decimal separators, currency\n\n```tsx\n// ✅ Good: Locale-aware formatting\nconst formatDate = (date: Date, locale: string) => {\n  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, {\n    dateStyle: 'long',\n  }).format(date);\n};\n\nconst formatCurrency = (amount: number, locale: string, currency: string) => {\n  return new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, {\n    style: 'currency',\n    currency,\n  }).format(amount);\n};\n```\n\n#### Text Expansion\n\n1. **Allow for expansion** - Some languages need 30-50% more space\n2. **Avoid fixed widths** - Use flexible layouts\n3. **Test with longer strings** - Use pseudo-localization\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)\n- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)\n- [A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/)\n- [Web.dev](https://web.dev/)\n- [Vercel Design System](https://vercel.com/design)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Accessible Button Component\n\n```tsx\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  onClick?: () => void;\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  disabled?: boolean;\n  loading?: boolean;\n  'aria-label'?: string;\n}\n\nexport function Button({\n  children,\n  onClick,\n  variant = 'primary',\n  disabled,\n  loading,\n  'aria-label': ariaLabel,\n}: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <button\n      onClick={onClick}\n      disabled={disabled || loading}\n      aria-disabled={disabled || loading}\n      aria-busy={loading}\n      aria-label={ariaLabel}\n      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}\n    >\n      {loading ? (\n        <>\n          <Spinner aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n          <span className=\"sr-only\">Loading...</span>\n        </>\n      ) : (\n        children\n      )}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Responsive Image Component\n\n```tsx\ninterface ResponsiveImageProps {\n  src: string;\n  alt: string;\n  width: number;\n  height: number;\n  priority?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport function ResponsiveImage({\n  src,\n  alt,\n  width,\n  height,\n  priority = false,\n}: ResponsiveImageProps) {\n  const basePath = src.replace(/\\.[^.]+$/, '');\n  const ext = src.match(/\\.([^.]+)$/)?.[1] || 'jpg';\n\n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source\n        srcSet={`${basePath}.avif`}\n        type=\"image/avif\"\n      />\n      <source\n        srcSet={`${basePath}.webp`}\n        type=\"image/webp\"\n      />\n      <img\n        src={src}\n        alt={alt}\n        width={width}\n        height={height}\n        loading={priority ? 'eager' : 'lazy'}\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </picture>\n  );\n}\n```\n",
